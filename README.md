# JellyFishing

This game was made for Mini Jam #153 on itch.io that lasted 2 days, from March 1st 2024 at 9:30 AM to March 4th 2024 at 9:30 AM with the theme being "fishing" and constraint being "no water". You can use your umbrella to jump and glide in the air and catch jellyfish under your net. If you touch them from below you will get stung and will fall out of the sky. Some jellyfish are special and can grant some bonuses like restoring health, granting short term immunity or giving extra score. Catching multiple jellyfish at the same time gives a better score.
